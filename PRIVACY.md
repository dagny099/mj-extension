# Privacy Policy for Midjourney Image Tracker

## Data Collection (or rather, what we don't collect!)
The Midjourney Image Tracker extension is pretty minimalist when it comes to your data:

1. **Bookmarked URLs** - These stay local on your device using Chrome's storage API. They never embark on internet adventures beyond your browser.

2. **User Feedback** (completely optional) - If you're kind enough to tell us what you think, we store:
   - The type of feedback (bug reports, feature wishes, etc.)
   - Your feedback text
   - Your email address (only if you decide to share it)
   - Basic browser information to help us troubleshoot

## What We Do With Your Data
- Bookmarked URLs are stored only on your device and are used exclusively to:
  • Display your saved images in the extension popup
  • Generate your personal gallery page
  • Create exportable collections (HTML or text files)
  • These URLs are never transmitted to our servers or any third parties

- Your feedback helps us make the extension better (and occasionally gives us the warm fuzzies)

## Third-Party Access
We do not share or sell any collected data with third parties. Your Midjourney bookmarks are your business, not ours to monetize.

## Data Storage
- Bookmarked URLs live in your browser's local storage 
- Feedback (if provided) is stored in Chrome's sync storage

## Your Rights
You can clear all stored data at any time by:
- Using the "Clear All" button in the extension popup
- Uninstalling the extension with a dramatic click

## Changes to this Policy
We will update this policy as needed to reflect any changes in our data practices.
